# [SourceHunt]() - A Reef hackathon Project




# Project Description

We are building a platform like ProductHunt named "SourceHunt" for the open-source community where people (Maintainers and Founders) from different organizations can list their organizations, and Contributors from different regions can learn more about the organization's ecosystem, opportunities they get if they contribute to those specific organizations, the past open-source programs in which organization has participated (programs like GSoC, LFX, polygon fellowship) and many more via this platform. We have brainstormed about the monetizing scheme of this project, and we listed down some unique features related to user profile, open-source jobs, leaderboard (acc to issues solving, and number of PRs), one-on-one mentorship from open-source contributors, issue hunt, organizations promotion (just like product hunt do for listed products) and many more, we can make developers profile like peerlist and other platforms like showcase and reward and support developers with crypto and NFTs according to there performance and solving of a critical issue in web 3 open-source orgs.
